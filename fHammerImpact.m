% Note that we are approximating the hammer as a slender rod with no mass with a cylinder on the end.
% We assumed that the mass of the rod was negligible in comparison to the hammer head and would thus only slightly affect the centre of gravity
% Therefore the centre of gravity lies at the centre of gravity of the cylinder shape on the end of the rod.
