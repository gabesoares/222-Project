h_1 = 0.11; % In metres, the diistance the centre of gravity travels from top to point of impact.

d = 0.055; % In metres, the distance from the centre of gravity of the hammer to the point of rotation.

% Note that we are approximating the hammer as a slender rod with no mass with a cylinder on the end.
% We assumed that the mass of the rod was negligible in comparison to the hammer head and would thus only slightly affect the centre of gravity
% Therefore the centre of gravity lies at the centre of gravity of the cylinder shape on the end of the rod.
% We can then approximate the moment of inertia as that of a cylinder, 0.5mr^2
