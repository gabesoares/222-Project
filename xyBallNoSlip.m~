% this function uses x and Y coordinates to determine the amount of time a
% ball took to fall down a ramp described by equation f
% Equation explanation: https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101229213823AAjuJJS
% It assumes no slipping. 

r = 0.07;    % radius of track
g = -9.81;    % gravity
R = 0.01;
m = 0.03;

vi = 0;
wi = 0;
I = 0.4 * m * R^2;


syms x;
f = -sqrt(r^2 - x^2);  % equation of track - a circle solved for y = f(x,r). Negative to agree with gravity. 

t = int(sqrt((7/10)*(1 + diff(f)^2)/(m*g*f + 0.5*m*vi^2 + 0.5*I*wi^2)), x, 0, 0.0699);
%t = (1/sqrt((10/7)*g)) * int(sqrt((1 + diff(f)^2)/f), x, 0, 0.0699);    % You can't integrate up to the radius, but you can get close
t = vpa(t);
